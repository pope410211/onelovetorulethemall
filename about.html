<h4>How We Met! <small>(It was AWESOME!)</small></h4>
<p>It was a beautiful November day in the Sunshine State, the sun was shining, birds were singing, the smell of salt water in the air, and a cool ocean breeze was blowing through.
Candace - who is the most amazing young woman in the whole 'verse - was hunting for a job with her sis Stephanie. She stood about 4’10 1/2“, shoulder length blonde hair, a smile to die for, and a voice of angels.

At the same time another guy, a handsome fellow wearing jeans and a t-shirt was meeting his friend for a cup of coffee. As Nick walked up to the Starbucks on the corner, his good friend Chelsea was already in conversation with Nick's future wife and her sister.
Nick sauntered up to them, Chelsea introduced them and a short conversation ensued, but all Nick could think about was who is this amazing woman. The twins went on to job hunt, Nick and Chelsea had their coffee, and Chelsea was questioned extensively who these women were, specifically Candace. </p>

<aside> Chelsea and Dixie who were close friends to Nick knew the twins longer than they knew Nick, and never introduced Nick and Candace... also were worried about Nick asking Candace out and semi said no - they thought he would corrupt her… Nick and Candace got their revenge later.</aside>

<p>A month later, the whole group went to the premiere of the <b><i>The Hobbit pt.1</i></b> where Nick didn't dress up as he was told Candace would be their and didn't want to embarrass her or Chelsea and Dixie.... Well Candace showed up in full Hobbit attire cosplay complete down to the hairy feet. It was GREAT.
   Sadly, Nick and Candace were unable to sit next to each other...despite both parties wanting to we were separated by friends. Skip ahead another month, and finally, Candace, Stephanie, Dixie, Phil, and Nick went to a wine bar and played some Jenga and scrabble! What fun! Followed by a visit to Menchies for frozen yogurt, hours of conversation, and fun. Alas, Candace moved back to Orlando for college, but there was a bright light. She facebook messaged Nick and what ensued was hours every night spent writing full letters to each other. She said she was coming up for spring break so I asked her out to dinner! She quickly replied that she would be up earlier for her mom's birthday.</p>

<p>Our fist date was 13.5 hours long, dinner, walk on the beach, talking all night, followed by breakfast at a Dunkin' Donuts. the date started at 6:00 PM and ended at 7:30 AM the next morning. It only ended because Nick had to work. Candace's mom, Rhonda, and Stephanie were freaking out a bit - had no idea where Candace was and that was very unusual for Candace to be out so late. They texted her but were trying to be so cool and casual about it, Candace had no idea they were worried. </p>
<p> That's where it began. And here we are now. About Nick and Candace about to say "I do" at the altar. It's just the start of another quest for these two. However anyone wanting to know more, can view the proposal video below.</p>
